# React-Terminal: Work in Progress 🚧

React-Terminal is an implementation of a terminal UI in React, built upon the robust foundation of [xterm](https://xtermjs.org/). While retaining the core functionality of xterm, React-Terminal introduces a set of styling controls and defaults to deliver a terminal experience that feels intuitive right out of the box.

## Features 🌟

- **Full xterm Compatibility:** Leverage the power and flexibility of xterm, right out of the box.
- **Styling Controls:** Easy-to-use styling controls to make the terminal look and feel the way you want.
- **Intuitive Defaults:** A curated set of default configurations for an out-of-the-box intuitive terminal experience.
- **React-Ready:** Seamlessly integrate with your React applications for a native terminal experience.

## Usage 🛠️

Import and utilize the React-Terminal component within your project.

\```typescript
import { Terminal } from 'react-terminal';

function App() {
return (
<Terminal />
);
}

export default App;
\```

## Customization 🎨

React-Terminal provides easy customization options to tailor the terminal UI according to your preferences.

\```typescript
<Terminal
options={{
    fontFamily: 'Monaco, monospace',
    theme: {
      background: '#202B33',
      foreground: '#F5F8FA',
    }
  }}
/>
\```
